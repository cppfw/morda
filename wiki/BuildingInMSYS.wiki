#Step-by-step building morda in Windows

=Step-by-step building morda in Windows using MinGW and MSYS=

 # Download *mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe* from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20120426/ here] and run it. Follow installation instructions bearing in mind the following:
   * When it asks about *Repository Catalogues* select "Use pre-packaged repository catalogues". Do NOT use "Download latest repository catalogues" because it will install g++ version 4.7 which is not stable yet and has bugs affecting *morda*.
   * When it asks about which components to install, select the following:
     # C Compiler
     # C++ Compiler
     # MSYS Basic System
     # MinGW Developer !ToolKit
 # Download *SlikSVN* from [http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download here], choose the package depending on your system, 32 or 64 bit.
    * Run the installer and follow instructions. Typical installation should be enough.
    * Open MSYS console (Start menu/MinGW/MinGW Shell). Note, that disks *C:*, *D:* etc. are mounted as */c* and */d* and so on. In the home folder create file called *.bashrc* with the following contents: *export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files/!SlikSvn/bin*
