= Attaching the GUI to your program

Attaching *morda* to your program is not very difficult.
Basically one needs to push mouse, keyboard and window events to *morda*,
call update() and render() methods from main loop and implement method
of posting an event to main event queue.

TODO: add the example to this repo

Refer to the link:https://github.com/igagis/mordaSDLexample[example] of using *morda* with SDL2.
